**Hello** Welcome user.

This is a Hangman Python Game, only use it in the terminal. 

In the future I will update it to use the Pygamev platform in the future. This is beginner-friendly for anyone who wants to learn about Python. 

I will make more projectd in the future but here are the steps for starting up the project. 


1. Create a folder and name it whatever you want
2. Open your terminal and type these commands:

`cd Desktop`

`cd {your folder name}`

`python3 --version` or `python --version`

It will start automatically. It has 50 very simple and easy words. If you want you can check the script and look at the Python list for some clues.
