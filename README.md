# Hangman-Game-Made-in-Python

Hello User, 
 
 I was developing another Python Project and this time I created Hangman game. 
 
 Here is the gameplay:
 
 **You have 4 lives** 
 
 if any of those lives run out, you lose!
 
 if you guess all the letters you win!
 ==========================================================================================
 
 In this Python script holds a list, with all 50 words that are easy and simple. I will change this and make it more and harder for the user. 
 This can make the gameplay challenging but fun. 
 
 I will also convert this Python script into the Pygame platform in the future.
 
 All you have to do is open up terminal and type `python3 script.py` and make sure you have python 3.6 or above. To check type in this command:
 
 `python3 --version`
 
 I hope you enjoy, I will update this in the future and make more fun Python projects
